### **Install MongoDB Community Edition** 
MongoDB 7.0 Community Edition supports the following 64-bit Ubuntu LTS (long-term support) 
releases on x86_64 architecture:

 - 22.04 LTS ("Jammy")
 - 20.04 LTS ("Focal")

MongoDB only supports the 64-bit versions of these platforms. To determine which Ubuntu release your host is running
, run the following command on the host's terminal:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/lsb-release
```

1. Import the public key used by the package management system:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gnupg curl
    ```
2. Create a list file for MongoDB
    - Create the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list file for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy):
    ```bash
    echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list
    ```
   - Create the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list file for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal):
    ```bash
   echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list
    ```
3. Reload local package database
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
4. Install the MongoDB packages
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```
### **Run MongoDB Community Edition**

1. **Start MongoDB** \
You can start the mongod process by issuing the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```
   If you receive an error similar to the following when starting mongod:
   ```bash
   Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.
   ```
   Run the following command first:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
   Then run the start command above again.

2. **Verify that MongoDB has started successfully.**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```
   You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```
   
3. **Stop MongoDB.**
   As needed, you can stop the mongod process by issuing the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mongod
   ```
4. **Restart MongoDB.**
   You can restart the mongod process by issuing the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mongod
   ```
You can follow the state of the process for errors or important messages by watching the output in the 
```/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``` file.

5. **Begin using MongoDB.**\
   Start a mongosh session on the same host machine as the mongod. You can run mongosh without any command-line 
   options to connect to a mongod that is running on your localhost with default port 27017.
   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```
   
## ü•≥Usage
